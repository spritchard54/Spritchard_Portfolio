      <p>
        I've worn a lot of different hats throughtout my professional career.
        After earning a B.S. in Communications Media from Indiana University of
        Pennsylvania I began my working career as a photojounralist at WBRE-TV
        in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania. After nearly five years in that field I
        felt like it was time to get out of the terrible weather and away from
        the low pay and I made the jump to working in media sales.<br /><br />
        Fast forward five years later and I caught the technology bug and began
        working in consuting as an Organizational Change Management Consultant.
        I learned a ton during that time about business, technology and
        consulting. The focus was not on techology itself though. It was on
        people, processes and technology.<br /><br />I currently work as a
        Customer Success Manager for a software company, but the role is still
        primarily account management. This brings be the current day where I am
        working on becoming a someone who spends their days working in code.
