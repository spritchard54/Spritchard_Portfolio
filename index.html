        <p>
            I've worn a lot of different hats throughtout my professional career. After earning a B.S. in Communications Media from Indiana University of Pennsylvania I began my working career as a photojounralist at WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania. After nearly five years in that field I felt like it was time to get out of the terrible weather and away from the low pay and I made the jump to working in media sales.<br><br> Fast forward five years later and I caught the technology bug and began working in consuting as an Organizational Change Management Consultant. I learned a ton during that time about business, technology and consulting. The focus was not on techology itself though. It was on people, processes and technology.<br><br>I currently work as a Customer Success Manager for a software company, but the role is still primarily account management. This brings be the current day where I am working on becoming a someone who spends their days working in code.
