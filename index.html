      <p>
        I've worn many different hats throughout my professional career.
        After earning a B.S. in Communications Media from
        <a href="https://www.iup.edu" target="_blank"
          >Indiana University of Pennsylvania</a
        >
        I began my professional career as a photojournalist at
        <a href="https://www.pahomepage.com" target="_blank">WBRE-TV</a>
        in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania. After nearly five years in that field, I
        felt like it was time to get out of the terrible weather and away from
        the low pay and I made the jump to work in media sales. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Not long after I caught the technology bug and began working in
        consulting as an Organizational Change Management Consultant. I learned
        a ton during that time about business, technology, and consulting. The
        focus was not on technology itself though. It was on people, processes,
        and technology. I currently work as a Customer Success Manager for a
        software company, but the role is still primarily account management.
        </p>
        <p>
        I've always enjoyed building things. There is something satisfying about coding. Often, you're starting from scratch. Slowly adding in content and functionality. It's a hobby at the moment. Maybe more than a hobby down the road. Stay tuned.
